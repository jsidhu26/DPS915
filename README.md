This program creates a 2D array of float pointers and populates it with random numbers.

### Instructions
- Uncomment the lines in ArrayProcessing.cpp if you want to see the random number assigned to each array element.
- Execute run.sh to compile, run and display the profiling on a UNIX enviroment.
- The program is executed with a sample 2D array of size 500 x 500.
- An 'ArrayProcessing' executable is created, and can be used to change the size. For example, the command 'ArrayProcessing 50' will execute the program with a 2D array of size 50x50.
